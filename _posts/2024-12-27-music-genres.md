This took my friends (Tommy and James) and I a few months to do -- spending 1-4 hours every night. We each did our own tier list, so this one is mine. We sampled anywhere between 5-15 songs from each of the 350+ genres. Please do not take offense. There is a chance I didn't sample the best songs from your favorite genre, or maybe I simply didn't like it. There's a lot of fatigue that goes into doing this, because it is such a large undertaking. I'll update this tier list once in a while if anything changes.
