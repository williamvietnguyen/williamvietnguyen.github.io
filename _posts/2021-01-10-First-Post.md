A little about my inspiration for this site.

Suppose I give an arbitrary instance in the past year such that in that instant, I learned something new. With alarming consistency, if I do not continue to apply this new knowledge in some form later on, I forget about its details. This has been the trend of my university experience. Only the things that I have found so interesting to the point that I revisit constantly, do I retain better. Hopefully this blog of sorts, will be helpful in combatting these issues for me. But more importantly, I want to be able to collect some assortment of knowledge here that I enjoy. Feel free to read if it interests you.
