### Investment Philosophy

Invest primarily in low-cost index funds - that have minimal to no overlap with each other - and that track the entire world equity market and domestic bond market. Contribute the maximum to tax-advantaged accounts before taxable accounts. Automatically reinvest all dividends. Shelter tax-inefficient assets in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid tax drag. Dollar cost average and avoid timing the market (often guilty of disobeying). We cannot predict the future, therefore we invest in the entire thing.

### Asset Class Allocations

An emergency fund of 3-6 months worth of expenses will be reserved in cash. This is due to popular advice regarding holding cash equivalents. Personal definition of “month worth of expenses” is rent.

I am currently holding series I savings bonds that will be sold after 1 year. After selling the series I savings bonds, I will leave fixed income allocation at 0. When I eventually decide to allocate domestic bonds (in 15-20 years), allocation of bonds will be done in tax-deferred accounts for tax-efficiency. The choice of bond fund will be some duration of treasuries, unless not available it will be total bond market funds. The choice of treasuries is to avoid the risk of corporate bonds and also having low correlation with equities.

No more than 5% of total assets will be in individual stocks, cryptocurrencies, and/or other speculative assets.

### Target Allocations

75% Total Domestic Stock Market

25% Total International Stock Market

### Rebalancing Protocol

Rebalancing the 401k will be done annually if the account strays too far away from the target allocations, but not necessarily always true. The goal is to only rebalance once annually. Then for taxable accounts, rebalancing would trigger capital gains taxes, so that is not advisable. So rebalancing the taxable accounts will be done through contributions that adjust the portfolio to meet those targets.

### Security Selection Criteria

A high priority on low-cost index funds. The expense ratio should be less than or equal to 40 basis points. A strong preference towards Vanguard ETFs and Fidelity mutual funds. Currently sticking to ETFs over mutual funds where I can, there is no good reason for why this decision is made. Generally avoid high expense ratio actively managed funds (though small cap value funds may be considered one day as a tilt).

### Short Term Liquidity Needs

There is a short term liquidity need for annual apartment hunting. Securing an apartment in NYC often requires a lot of cash on hand to pay for various fees, security deposits, movers, and so on. The emergency fund will be closer to 6 months to accommodate this liquidity need.

### Benchmarks

There is good reason to try to benchmark the portfolio’s performance despite the Boglehead approach - because of various investment decisions that aren’t just “total market cap weighted and chill''. Therefore, the most reasonable benchmark is exactly that, a market cap weighted index fund. Will be choosing VT/VTWAX, Vanguard’s total world stock index fund. If my portfolio, with its slightly more fancy decisions, is not better than a 1-fund portfolio, then I am just overcomplicating my investment life with no tangible returns. There’s also no good reason to compare the portfolio against the benchmark in the short term either because the risk premiums may not be rewarded until much later.

### Monitoring Frequency

I probably look at my portfolio more often than it is recommended to do so for a Boglehead investor. That being said, I record the state of my portfolio at the beginning of each month in a spreadsheet.

### IPS Revision

The document should be reassessed annually, primarily to adjust target allocations if any change is needed. Avoid changing investment philosophy. As such, the philosophy are long term principles, whereas the target allocations are more short term decisions and flexible to change.
The IPS can also be revised after major financial decisions or events. Example instances where the IPS should be reassessed and revised are: new job, new investment account opening, major life events, physical relocations, big financial decisions like down payments, and so on.
