I'm a 4th year undergraduate at the [University of Washington](https://washington.edu) in Seattle studying Computer Science, where I focus my studies in algorithm design. Things I enjoy and love include: speed chess, spending time with friends, my mom and her cooking, rain and gloomy skies, true crime stories, and discovering new music to listen to. Things I am passionate about include: political campaign strategy, rhetoric, education, and economic human rights.
