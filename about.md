I'm a 3rd year undergraduate at the [University of Washington](https://washington.edu) in Seattle studying Computer Science, where I focus my studies in algorithm design. Things I enjoy and love include: speed chess, spending time with friends, my mom and her cooking, rain and gloomy skies, true crime stories, and discovering new music to listen to. Things I am passionate about include: political campaign strategy, rhetoric, education, and economic human rights.

I have been a teaching assistant for [CSE 417](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse417/21wi/) at the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://cs.washington.edu). Currently I am a software engineer intern at [Sage Bionetworks](https://sagebionetworks.org), contributing to the back end of the [Synapse Platform](https://www.synapse.org).
