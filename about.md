I'm a 4th year undergraduate at the [University of Washington](https://washington.edu) in Seattle studying Computer Science, where I focus my studies in algorithm design and engineering systems. Things I enjoy and love include: speed chess (2000 rating on chess.com and 2200 on lichess.org), spending time with friends, my mom and her cooking, rain and gloomy skies, true crime stories, and discovering new music to listen to.
